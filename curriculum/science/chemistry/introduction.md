# Chemistry - Matter and Its Changes

## ⚗️ INTRODUCTION TO MATTER

### What is Matter?
- **Definition**: Anything that has mass and takes up space
- **States of Matter**: Solid, liquid, gas, plasma
- **Properties**: Color, texture, density, solubility

### Atoms & Elements
- **Atomic Structure**: Protons, neutrons, electrons
- **Periodic Table**: Organization of elements
- **Common Elements**: Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen

## 🔬 CHEMICAL & PHYSICAL CHANGES

### Physical Changes
- **Definition**: Change in appearance without new substance
- **Examples**: Melting, freezing, dissolving, cutting
- **Reversible**: Can often be undone

### Chemical Changes
- **Definition**: Formation of new substances
- **Examples**: Burning, rusting, cooking, digestion
- **Indicators**: Color change, gas production, temperature change

### Conservation of Matter
- **Law**: Matter cannot be created or destroyed
- **Evidence**: Mass stays same in closed systems
- **Applications**: Chemical equations must balance

## 🧪 ACIDS, BASES & SOLUTIONS

### pH Scale
- **Acids**: pH less than 7 (vinegar, lemon juice)
- **Bases**: pH greater than 7 (baking soda, soap)
- **Neutral**: pH equals 7 (pure water)

### Chemical Reactions
- **Reactants & Products**: Starting and ending materials
- **Reaction Rates**: Temperature, concentration, catalysts
- **Energy Changes**: Exothermic (releases heat) vs endothermic (absorbs heat)

### Solutions & Mixtures
- **Solutions**: Uniform mixtures (salt water)
- **Suspensions**: Particles settle out (muddy water)
- **Colloids**: Particles don't settle (milk, gelatin)
